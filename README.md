# HashVault

## ✨ Introduction

This repository showcases a modular, secure C# WinForms application for generating and exporting or appending file hash snapshots to a `.txt` file.
Built to demonstrate modular coding architecture, user-centric design in a desktop environment, and security awareness. Also, this project was using as a means for me to gather experience in software development, C# programming and Visual Studio solution management.
